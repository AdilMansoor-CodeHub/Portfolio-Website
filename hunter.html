                <h2>Stealth: First Semester Game Project</h2>

                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>Presenting my first semester game project at the Game Showcase of BSCGD: <strong>Stealth!</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>Game Concept</strong></p>
                <p>Stealth is a maze-based game where the objective is to catch and eliminate enemies within a limited time. The game challenges players to navigate the maze efficiently while strategically taking down opponents before the clock runs out.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Development Details</strong></p>
                <p>This project was developed in C++ using the "graphics.h" library. It was an exciting opportunity to apply fundamental programming skills and explore game development concepts in a practical setting. The use of the "graphics.h" library allowed for the creation of basic graphical elements and game mechanics.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Showcase Experience</strong></p>
                <p>This game was proudly presented as part of the Game Showcase during my first semester in the BSc Game Development program, marking an important milestone in my journey as a game developer.</p>
