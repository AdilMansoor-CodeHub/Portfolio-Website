            <h2>Zombie Showdown: Hyper-Casual Game Development</h2>

            <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
            <p>"Zombie Showdown" is an engaging hyper-casual game where players must strategically battle waves of material-based zombies using a slingshot. The game challenges players to exploit the specific vulnerabilities of each zombie type—Fire, Ice, Wood—by selecting the most effective projectile.</p>
            
            <p><strong>My Role</strong></p>
            <p>I worked as a Game Developer in a team of four, contributing to the programming and implementation of core gameplay mechanics, including the unique interaction system where players target zombie weaknesses with specific projectiles.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Gameplay Highlights</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strategic Combat:</strong> Players must choose the right projectile to counter each zombie type, adding a layer of strategy to the fast-paced gameplay.</li>
                <li><strong>Material-Based Zombies:</strong> Different zombie types have distinct weaknesses—Fire, Ice, and Wood—that players must exploit to progress through the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Engaging Mechanics:</strong> The slingshot mechanic provides intuitive controls, making the game accessible while still offering depth and challenge.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Team Collaboration</strong></p>
            <p>This project was a collaborative effort, with each team member bringing their unique skills to the table. My contributions focused on gameplay development, ensuring that the interactions and mechanics were both fun and functional.</p>
